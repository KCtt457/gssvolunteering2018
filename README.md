# Volunteering in Canada: Insights from the Canadian General Social Survey 2018

This repository contains the code to produce a paper which analyzes results from the 2018 Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) on Giving, Volunteering & Participating. The survey microdata was obtained through [CHASS](http://dc.chass.utoronto.ca/myaccess.html) at the University of Toronto, which is accessible to members of the University of Toronto community. The raw data is NOT included in this repository as I do have permission to share it publicly.

To obtain the data and process it in order to be able to reproduce the paper, please follow the commented instructions given in the 01-gss_cleaning.R file in the scripts folder. It is preferable to store the downloaded data files in the inputs/data folder.

The repository is organised as follows:

* inputs/data: contains the pdf and Rmd files for the datasheet I created for the 2018 Canadian General Social Survey.
* outputs/paper: contains the pdf of the paper, and Rmd and bibtex files used to produce it.
* scripts: contains data cleaning and simulation R files.
* gss_volunteering2018.Rproj
