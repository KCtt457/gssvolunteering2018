# Volunteering in Canada: Insights from the Canadian General Social Survey 2018

This repository contains the code to produce a paper which analyzes results from the 2018 Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) on Giving, Volunteering & Participating. The survey microdata was obtained through [CHASS](http://dc.chass.utoronto.ca/myaccess.html) at the University of Toronto, which I have access to as a student, and is NOT included in this repository as I do have permission to share it.

The repository is organised as follows:

* outputs/paper: contains the pdf of the paper, and Rmd and bibtex files used to produce it.
* scripts: contains data cleaning and simulation R files.
* gss_volunteering2018.Rproj
